A numerical test to show the removal of reverberation effects through spectral whitening.

## Turn on and off the reverberation, apply spectral whitening:

{% include aligner.html images="feature-img/autopic.png" column=1 %}

## Stacked deconvolved signal before spectral whitening:

{% include aligner.html images="feature-img/Stacked before.png" column=1 %}

## Stacked deconvolved signal after spectral whitening:

{% include aligner.html images="feature-img/Stacked after.png" column=1 %}
