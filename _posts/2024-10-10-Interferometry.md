An interactive Pluto notebook simulating seismic interferometry in a homogeneous medium. Sources emitting single pulse are randomly distributed around two receivers. 

## Change the setting to explore:

{% include aligner.html images="feature-img/setting.png" column=1 %}

## Cross-corelation stack and true Green function:

{% include aligner.html images="feature-img/stackcorr.png" column=1 %}

## [Go to the notebook.](https://rkoireng.github.io/pluto/Interferometry.html)
To explore the different settings, run the notebook locally. Take easy! Installing Julia and Pluto is a piece of cake.
